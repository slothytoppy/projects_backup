write nvim keymaps in init.lua
and more for neovim, will probably entail me writing my own version of plugins that fit into an init.lua without the need for a plugin manager
write ls in c
write cat in c
write du in c
write an RPC in c
write my own `file` in c
write my own netrw for nvim
write a c library full of conveniences like an easy way of interacting with the file system, interacting with the user, progress indicator, more to be decided
